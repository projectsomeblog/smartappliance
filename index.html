        <h2>Common Samsung Washing Machine Problems</h2>

        <p>Samsung washing machines are designed to last, but several common issues can affect their performance. Recognizing these problems early can save you both time and money. Some of the most frequently reported issues include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Washer Not Spinning or Agitating:</strong> If your Samsung washing machine fails to spin or agitate properly, it could be due to a worn-out drive belt, faulty motor, or a malfunctioning lid switch. Our technicians have the expertise to pinpoint the root cause and restore your machine’s functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Water Leakage:</strong> Leaks can occur due to damaged hoses, faulty door seals, or blocked drainage systems. Water leakage is not only inconvenient but can also damage your flooring. With professional <strong>Samsung washing machine repairs in Durbanville</strong>, you can rest assured that the problem will be fixed efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Unusual Noises:</strong> Grinding, squeaking, or thumping noises during operation are often signs of mechanical issues. Bearings, pulleys, or drum alignment problems are common culprits. Our team has the right tools and knowledge to eliminate these noises and ensure smooth operation.</li>
            <li><strong>Error Codes:</strong> Modern Samsung washing machines feature digital displays that show error codes to indicate specific faults. These codes can range from water inlet problems to sensor malfunctions. Our technicians are well-versed in decoding these errors and implementing precise solutions.</li>
            <li><strong>Drainage Issues:</strong> If your washing machine is not draining properly, it may be due to a clogged pump, blocked hose, or defective drain motor. Quick and effective repair can prevent further damage to your appliance.</li>
